# ASPDashboard

Having never used ASP.NET and TypeScript before this is a playground to get familiar with both technologies.

Based on the Asp.NET core template two pages were added: Notes and BlockGame

Notes is a small area where you can CRUD notes which are stored in an SQLite database

BlockGame is a Tetris clone originally wrote in JavaScript and updated for TypeScript
