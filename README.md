# ASPDashboard

Having never used ASP.NET and TypeScript before this is a playground to get familiar with both technologies.

Based on the Asp.NET core template two pages were added: Notes and BlockGame

Notes is a small area where you can CRUD notes which are stored in an SQLite database

BlockGame is a Tetris clone originally wrote in JavaScript and updated for TypeScript

It also features some xpath based parsing of some german news pages. This is likely to break as soon as these pages change their html layout.

# This prototype is considered feature complete. No further development is intended
